# What is the significance of the key prop in React lists? 

- In React lists (when we render multiple items), the key prop helps React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed. This makes rendering much faster and more efficient.

## Why is key important?
- It gives each element a unique identity.

- Helps React reconcile (compare old vs new UI) quickly.

- Without a unique key, React might get confused and cause unnecessary re-renders or even bugs in complex UIs.

## Example:
```jsx
const fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange'];

const FruitList = () => (
  <ul>
    {fruits.map((fruit, index) => (
      <li key={fruit}>{fruit}</li> // `fruit` is used as the unique key here
    ))}
  </ul>
);
```
- Here, each <li> has a unique key.

- React knows exactly which <li> is which, even if the list changes later.

## Important tips:
- Keys should be unique among siblings. (Not globally unique across the whole app, just among the list items.)

- Don't use the array index as a key unless you have no better unique id â€” using indexes can cause issues when the list order changes.

## Good key: 
Something unique and stable (like a database id, username, etc.).
## Bad key: 
Array indexes, random numbers generated every time.
