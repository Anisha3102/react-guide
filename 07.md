# How does React handle two-way data binding?

- React doesn’t implement two-way data binding in the traditional sense like frameworks such as Angular do. Instead, it follows a unidirectional data flow—data flows from parent to child via props, and component state is updated explicitly.

- However, two-way data binding can still be manually implemented in React when needed—especially in form handling—by synchronizing component state and input values.

## Here's how it works (kind of like two-way binding):
- State holds the data (the "model").
- Input field displays the data and listens for user input (the "view").
- onChange handler updates the state, which re-renders the view.

## Example:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function TwoWayBindingExample() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setName(e.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={name} onChange={handleChange} />
      <p>Hello, {name}!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
> value={name} binds the input to state (one direction).

> onChange={handleChange} updates the state when the input changes (other direction).

-  So, while React doesn't have automatic two-way binding, you can easily emulate it by connecting state and handlers in your components.
