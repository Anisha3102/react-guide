# Explain how React batches state updates.

## What is Batching in React?
- Batching is React’s way of grouping multiple state updates together into a single re-render, instead of re-rendering the component after every individual update.

- This reduces the number of times the UI is updated = better performance.

## Example (without batching, you'd expect 3 renders):
```jsx
setCount(c => c + 1);
setCount(c => c + 1);
setCount(c => c + 1);
```
- Thanks to batching, React will only re-render once, and you'll see the final count increased by 3.

## When does React batch updates?
- React automatically batches state updates in:

>Event handlers (like onClick, onChange)
>Lifecycle methods
>Hooks (e.g. useEffect)
>Concurrent rendering

## React didn’t always batch updates in:
>Timeouts (setTimeout, setInterval)
>Promises / async code
>Native event listeners

- Before React 18, those async cases triggered separate renders.

### React 18 changed the game
- React 18 introduced automatic batching for all updates, even inside async functions:

```jsx

// ✅ React 18+ batches this
fetchData().then(() => {
  setLoading(false);
  setData(result);
  // React batches both, one re-render
});
```
