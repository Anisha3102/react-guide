## What is the Outlet component in React Router?

- The <Outlet /> component is a placeholder used in nested routes to render child components.

- Think of it like a dynamic slot where the child route’s component will be rendered inside the parent’s layout.

## Example: Basic Use of <Outlet />
- Suppose we have a layout that all dashboard routes should share:

```jsx
// Layout.js
import { Outlet } from "react-router-dom";

export default function Layout() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dashboard Layout</h1>
      <nav>/* nav links here */</nav>
      <main>
        <Outlet /> {/* This is where nested route components render */}
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}
```
- Now set up routes:

```jsx
import { Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Layout from "./Layout";
import DashboardHome from "./DashboardHome";
import DashboardSettings from "./DashboardSettings";

function App() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Layout />}>
        <Route index element={<DashboardHome />} />
        <Route path="settings" element={<DashboardSettings />} />
      </Route>
    </Routes>
  );
}
```
## What Happens Here:
- Visiting /dashboard renders Layout + DashboardHome.

- Visiting /dashboard/settings renders Layout + DashboardSettings.

- Whatever child route is matched, its component goes into the <Outlet />.

## When to Use It:
- Use <Outlet /> when:

- We are building nested routes.

- We want a shared layout (like a sidebar, header, etc) with route-specific content inside.
