# What is the purpose of dangerouslySetInnerHTML? 

## What is dangerouslySetInnerHTML in React?

- dangerouslySetInnerHTML is a special React prop that lets you inject raw HTML directly into your component.
- It’s called "dangerously" because if you’re not careful, it can open up security risks, like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

## Why/When would you use it?
React normally escapes HTML to keep your app safe:

```jsx

<p>{"<b>Hello</b>"}</p> // shows as: <b>Hello</b> (not bold)
```

> But sometimes, you really want to insert real HTML—like if you're:
- Rendering content from a CMS
- Displaying HTML from user input (e.g. blog post formatting)
- Injecting trusted HTML (like from your own backend)

>That’s where dangerouslySetInnerHTML comes in.

## Example:
```jsx

function MyComponent() {
  const htmlContent = "<strong>Hello, world!</strong>";

  return (
    <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: htmlContent }} />
  );
}
```
> This will render as: Hello, world! (bold)

## Why is it dangerous?
- If the HTML you're injecting contains something like:

```html
<script>alert('Hacked!');</script>
```
- Then the browser will run it, which can be very bad if that content came from a user or third-party source.

> So React makes you type "dangerously" to remind you: "Are you sure you want to do this?"
