
# What are the rules of hooks in React? 

## Only call hooks at the top level

- Don’t use them inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.

- This keeps the order of hooks the same every time a component renders, which is important for React to track state and other hook-related data correctly.

## Only call hooks from React functions

- We can use them in functional components or custom hooks.

- We Don’t use them in regular JavaScript functions or class components.

## Name custom hooks with "use"

- For example, we use useMyHook instead of just myHook.

- This helps React know it's a hook and lets tools like ESLint catch mistakes.
