# How does Redux Thunk help in handling asynchronous actions?

## What is Redux Thunk?
- Redux Thunk is middleware that lets you write async logic in your action creators.

## How It Works
- Normally, action creators return plain objects.
- With Thunk, they can return functions instead.

### This function can:
- Do async tasks (like API calls)

- Dispatch actions before and after the async operation

## Example
```js
const fetchUser = () => {
  return async (dispatch) => {
    dispatch({ type: 'LOADING_USER' });
    const res = await fetch('/api/user');
    const data = await res.json();
    dispatch({ type: 'SET_USER', payload: data });
  };
};
```
## Setup
```js
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));
```
 ### In short: 
- Redux Thunk makes it easy to handle API calls and other async logic inside Redux!
