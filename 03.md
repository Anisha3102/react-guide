# How can you prevent a component from re-rendering?

## For Class Components

### Use shouldComponentUpdate()
This lifecycle method lets you control whether the component should update or not.

```js
shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
  // Return false to prevent re-render
  return nextProps.value !== this.props.value;
}
```

### Extend React.PureComponent
This is a version of Component that implements a shallow prop and state comparison in shouldComponentUpdate() automatically.

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.PureComponent {
  // No need to write shouldComponentUpdate manually
}
```

 ## For Functional Components
### 1. Use React.memo()
This is a higher-order component that does a shallow comparison of props and skips rendering if nothing changed.

```jsx

const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
  // your component logic
});

```
### 2. Use useMemo() or useCallback() for expensive calculations or functions
These don’t prevent re-renders by themselves, but they help avoid unnecessary recalculations or function recreations.

```jsx
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);

const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  doSomething(a, b);
}, [a, b]);
```

## Keep state as local as possible.

## Avoid anonymous functions in JSX if re-renders are a problem.

## Use key props wisely in lists — changing keys unnecessarily can trigger extra renders.
