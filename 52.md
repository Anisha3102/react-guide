## What Are Hooks in React?
- Hooks are special functions introduced in React 16.8 that let us use state and other React features in functional components, which were previously only available in class components.

### They allow us to:

- Manage state (useState)

- Handle side effects (useEffect)

- Access context (useContext)

- Optimize performance (useMemo, useCallback)

- And moreâ€”all without writing class components.

### Commonly Used React Hooks (in Markdown Table)

| Hook             | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `useState`       | Adds local state to functional components.                              |
| `useEffect`      | Performs side effects (e.g., data fetching, DOM updates).               |
| `useContext`     | Accesses values from React Context without using a Consumer.            |
| `useRef`         | Creates a reference to a DOM element or stores a mutable value.         |
| `useMemo`        | Memoizes expensive computations to optimize performance.                |
| `useCallback`    | Returns a memoized callback function to prevent unnecessary re-renders. |
| `useReducer`     | An alternative to `useState` for complex state logic (like Redux).      |
| `useLayoutEffect`| Like `useEffect` but runs **synchronously** after all DOM mutations.    |
| `useImperativeHandle` | Customizes the instance value exposed when using `ref` in parent.  |
