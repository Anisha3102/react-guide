# What is the purpose of state in React?

- The purpose of state in React is to store and manage data that can change over time â€” and when that data changes, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect the new state in the UI. ðŸš€

## Think of state as:
- A memory inside a component.

- Data that the component controls itself (unlike props, which are passed from outside).

- A trigger for React to update the screen when something important happens (like a user clicking a button, typing input, etc.).

## Example (using useState in a functional component):
```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
- count is the state.

- setCount is the function used to update the state.
 
- Every time we click the button, the count goes up and React automatically re-renders the UI!

|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------       |
| **Initialization**     | Use `useState()` in function components or `this.state` in class components        |
| **Updating**           | Call the updater function (e.g., `setCount`) or `this.setState()` in classes       |
| **Triggers re-render** | Whenever state changes, React re-renders the component                             |
| **Component-specific** | Each component manages its own state (unless you lift it up or use a global store) |
