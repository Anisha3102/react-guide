# Explain the concept of nested routes in React Router

## What Are Nested Routes?
- Nested routes allow you to define routes within routes, reflecting the hierarchical structure of your UI in the URL and routing configuration.

- They enable you to create parent-child relationships between views, where a parent component provides a layout or context, and child routes render inside it.

## Why Use Nested Routes?
- Modular UI: Many UIs have shared layouts (e.g., a dashboard with a sidebar) where only a portion of the screen changes depending on the route.

- Maintainability: Nesting routes keeps routing definitions clean and organized, especially in large applications.

- Logical Structure: URLs like /dashboard/profile or /dashboard/settings make sense to users and developers when tied to a shared layout.

## How They Work (Conceptually)
- A parent route defines a layout component (like a page with navigation or sidebar).

- Child routes are nested under the parent and are rendered inside a special placeholder (<Outlet />) in the parent.

- The parent component is always rendered; the child component changes based on the URL.

## Analogy
- Think of nested routes like folders within folders:

- /dashboard → opens the main "Dashboard" folder (layout)

- /dashboard/profile → opens a subfolder inside the dashboard (child route)

- The main folder (layout) stays open while you explore subfolders (child views)


### Think of nested routes like components within components, tied to URLs within URLs.

- Example structure:

```bash
/dashboard
/dashboard/settings
/dashboard/profile
```
- These could all render inside a shared Dashboard layout.

## Step-by-Step: Using Nested Routes in React Router v6+
### 1. Create a Layout Component
- This component renders common UI (like a sidebar, navbar) and an <Outlet /> where child routes appear.

```jsx
// DashboardLayout.jsx
import { Outlet, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function DashboardLayout() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Dashboard</h2>
      <nav>
        <Link to="profile">Profile</Link>
        <Link to="settings">Settings</Link>
      </nav>
      <Outlet /> {/* Child routes will render here */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
### 2. Define Routes with Children
```jsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/dashboard" element={<DashboardLayout />}>
    <Route path="profile" element={<Profile />} />
    <Route path="settings" element={<Settings />} />
  </Route>
</Routes>
```
- URL /dashboard/profile → renders DashboardLayout with Profile inside

- URL /dashboard/settings → renders DashboardLayout with Settings inside

### 3. Nested Route Components Render in <Outlet />
- The parent component (e.g., DashboardLayout) always renders.

- The specific child route fills in the <Outlet />.
