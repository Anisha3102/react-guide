# How do you combine multiple useEffect hooks in a single component?

- Combining multiple useEffect hooks in a single React component is totally valid and often a good way to separate concerns.
- Each useEffect can handle a distinct side effect, and they will run independently based on their dependency arrays.


```jsx

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  // Effect for count
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Count changed:', count);
    // You can do something with count, like analytics or updating the document title
    document.title = `Count is ${count}`;
  }, [count]); // Runs only when count changes

  // Effect for name
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Name changed:', name);
    // Maybe fetch user data or something else with name
  }, [name]); // Runs only when name changes

  // Effect that runs only once on mount
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Component mounted');
    // Initial fetch or setup
    return () => {
      console.log('Component unmounted');
    };
  }, []); // Empty array = only on mount and unmount

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
## Tips:

### Keep effects focused: 
It's better to split them than to cram everything into one big useEffect.

### ependencies matter: 
Each useEffect hook watches its own dependencies, so updates happen when they need to.

### Cleanup functions:
 You can include return () => {} inside any useEffect to handle cleanup like event listeners or intervals.
