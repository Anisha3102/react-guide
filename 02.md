# Q Explain the difference between componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate.

## componentDidMount()

### When it's called:
Right after the component is mounted (i.e., inserted into the DOM) — this only happens once during the component's lifecycle.

### Use cases:

- Fetching data from an API

- Setting up subscriptions (e.g., websockets)

- Initializing third-party libraries

- Any side effects that should happen once when the component loads


## componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState)

### When it's called:
Every time the component updates — either because props or state changed.

### Use cases:

- Responding to prop or state changes

- Fetching new data when props change

- Running code that depends on updated values
