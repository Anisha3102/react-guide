# How does useState work, and what does it return? 

## How useState Works in React
- The useState hook is used to add state to a functional component. It lets our component "remember" values between renders.

### Syntax
```js
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
```

- state: The current value of the state.

- setState: A function to update that state.

- initialValue: The initial value assigned to the state (only used on the first render).

### What useState Returns
- It returns an array with two elements:

- The current state value.

- A function to update the state.

> We usually destructure the array using array destructuring syntax:

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```
### Here:

- count is the current state.

- setCount is a function to update count.

### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
- When the button is clicked, setCount updates the state and causes the component to re-render with the new state value.
