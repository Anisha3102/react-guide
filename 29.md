# How do you handle 404 pages with React Router?

## React Router v6+ (latest version)
- In v6, we handle 404 pages by using a catch-all path="*" route, usually at the end of your route list:

```jsx

import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./pages/Home";
import About from "./pages/About";
import NotFound from "./pages/NotFound";

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        
        {/* 404 Page */}
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

## How it works:
- path="*" matches any route not previously matched.

- It should always come after all your other Route definitions.

- This route is your fallback, so we can show a custom NotFound component or redirect if we want.

## Redirecting to a 404 Page
If we want to redirect to a 404 route from within other components or logic:

```jsx
import { Navigate } from "react-router-dom";

// Example usage:
<Route path="/old-route" element={<Navigate to="/404" replace />} />
```
- And define your 404 route like:

```jsx
<Route path="/404" element={<NotFound />} />
```
- But using path="*" is often cleaner.
