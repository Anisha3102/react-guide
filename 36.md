## What is the difference between Redux and the Context API?

| Feature                     | **Redux**                                              | **Context API**                                         |
|---------------------------- |--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔧 **Purpose**              | State management library for complex, scalable apps    | Built-in React API for prop drilling avoidance          |
| 🧠 **State Management**     | Centralized, predictable, and powerful                 | Simple and localized, suitable for lighter use cases    |
| ⚙️ **Setup**                | Requires installation and setup (`redux`,`react-redux`) | Built into React, no external library needed           |
| 📦 **State Structure**      | Global store with reducers, actions, middleware        | Direct state sharing through provider/consumer pattern  |
| 🔄 **Data Flow**            | Unidirectional and predictable (action →reducer→state) | Unidirectional, but lacks built-in update flow control  |
| 🧩 **Boilerplate**          | More boilerplate (though Redux Toolkit reduces this)   | Less boilerplate, simple to use                         |
| 🚀 **Performance**          | More efficient with proper setup and memoization       | Can cause unnecessary re-renders if not optimized       |
| 🔌 **DevTools & Middleware**| Advanced DevTools, time-travel debugging, middleware   | No built-in support for DevTools or middleware          |
| 📈 **Best Use Case**        | Large applications with complex state logic            | Small to medium apps or for theme/auth-like data        |
