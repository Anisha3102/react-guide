# How do you use refs in React, and what are their use cases?

- In React, refs are used to get direct access to a DOM element or a React component instance. They’re created using the useRef hook in functional components or createRef in class components.

- A common use case is when we need to interact with a DOM node imperatively—for example, focusing an input field, scrolling to an element, or integrating with a third-party library that manipulates the DOM directly.

## Here's a quick example:

```jsx
const inputRef = useRef(null);

useEffect(() => {
  inputRef.current.focus();
}, []);

return <input ref={inputRef} />;
```
- Besides accessing DOM nodes, useRef is also useful for storing mutable values that persist across renders without causing re-renders.
 For example, tracking previous props or storing a timer ID.

## In short, refs are ideal when you need to:

- Access or modify the DOM directly

- Store values across renders without triggering re-renders

- Work with third-party libraries

- Control child components using forwardRef
