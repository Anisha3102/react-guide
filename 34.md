# Explain the role of actions, reducers, and store in Redux.

## Actions – The "what happened?"
- Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe an event or intention to change the state.

- Every action must have a type property (a string that tells what kind of action it is).

- Optionally, actions may carry data (usually in a payload).

### Example:
```js
const addItemAction = {
  type: 'ADD_ITEM',
  payload: { id: 1, name: 'Notebook' }
};
```
- We dispatch actions using store.dispatch(action) or through useDispatch() in React.


## Reducers – The "how the state changes"
- Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action, then return a new state.

- They don’t mutate the state — they return a new copy of it.

### Example:
```js
function cartReducer(state = [], action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_ITEM':
      return [...state, action.payload];
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```
- We can combine multiple reducers (e.g., for user, cart, etc.) using combineReducers.


## Store – The "where the state lives"
- The store is the single source of truth.

- It holds the state and provides methods like:

- getState() – get the current state

- dispatch(action) – send actions to update state

- subscribe(listener) – listen for state changes


## Creating a store:
```js
import { createStore } from 'redux';

const store = createStore(cartReducer);
```

- In React apps, the store is made available to components via the <Provider> from react-redux.

## How They Work Together
- UI triggers an action → dispatch({ type: 'ADD_ITEM' })

- Store sends the action to reducers

- Reducers compute a new state

- Store updates, components re-render with new state
