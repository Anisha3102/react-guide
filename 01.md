# Q - What is the purpose of ReactDOM.render() method ?

The ReactDOM.render() method is used to render a React element (or component)...

### Purpose of ReactDOM.render

- Mounts the React app to the actual HTML page.

- Injects a React component (or a tree of components) into a specific DOM element.

- Connects the virtual DOM (Reactâ€™s internal rendering engine) to the real DOM in the browser.


### Syntax

```js
ReactDOM.render(element, container);
```


> element: The React element or component you want to render.

> container: The DOM node where you want to render the element


```js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```
