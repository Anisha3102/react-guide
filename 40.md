#  What is mobx, and how does it differ from Redux for state management?

## What is MobX?
- MobX is a state management library for JavaScript and React applications that uses observables to automatically track and manage state changes. - It's designed to make state management more reactive and easy-to-use by automatically updating your UI when the state changes, without needing to manually dispatch actions or use reducers like in Redux.

## Core Concepts of MobX:
- Observables: MobX makes your state observable, meaning any component or function that uses this state will automatically update when the state changes.

- Actions: Functions that modify the observable state. They must be wrapped in action to indicate changes to the state.

- Computed Values: Derived state values that are automatically recalculated when the observable state changes.

- Reactions: MobX allows you to react to state changes and trigger side effects when data changes.

## Key Differences Between MobX and Redux:

| Feature              | MobX                                                      | Redux                                                      |

| **Philosophy**        | Reactive Programming (Automatic updates based on state changes) | Explicit State Management (Actions and Reducers)           |
| **State Management**  | State is observable,and UI auto-updates when state changes | State is immutable, modified through actions and reducers |
| **Boilerplate**       | Minimal (No need for actions, reducers, or middleware)    | More boilerplate (Actions, Reducers, Store setup)          |
| **State Mutability**  | State is mutable and modified directly in actions         | State is immutable, with reducers returning new copies     |
| **Reactivity**        | Automatic updates to the UI when the state changes        | Manual updates via dispatching actions                     |
| **Learning Curve**    | Simpler and more intuitive for small apps or teams        | Steeper learning curve due to actions, reducers,middleware |

## When to Use MobX vs Redux?
### Use MobX if:

- We prefer a simpler and more reactive approach.

- Our app doesn't need to follow strict patterns and you need less boilerplate.

- We have a smaller project or one where the state needs to change automatically based on user interactions.

### Use Redux if:

- We need a predictable and structured state management system.

- Our application is large and complex with a well-defined data flow.

- We prefer immovable state and want more control over state updates (via actions and reducers).

## Quick Comparison Example:
### MobX:
```js
import { observable, action } from "mobx";

class Store {
  @observable counter = 0;
  
  @action increment() {
    this.counter++;
  }
}

const store = new Store();
store.increment();  // Automatically updates UI
```

## Redux:
```js
// Action
const increment = { type: 'INCREMENT' };

// Reducer
const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// Store
const store = createStore(counterReducer);
store.dispatch(increment);  // Manually trigger UI update
```

## Conclusion:
- MobX is more automatic and reactive, making it easier for smaller projects or apps where we want automatic updates without a lot of boilerplate.

- Redux is more structured and predictable, ideal for large applications where state flows need to be strictly managed.
