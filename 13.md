# What is the difference between useState and useReducer?

| Feature           | useState                                    | useReducer                                                            |
|------------------ |---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Simplicity        | Very simple                                 | More structured, but more verbose                                     |
| State type        | Primitive or single object                  | Complex objects, multiple values                                      |
| Update logic      | Inline                                      | Centralized in reducer function                                       |
| Performance       | Lighter in simple components                | Better when updates are conditional or state is large                 |
| Predictability    | Okay                                        | More predictable (like a state machine)                               |
