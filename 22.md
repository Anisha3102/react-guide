# What is the difference between BrowserRouter and HashRouter?

## BrowserRouter

- Uses HTML5 History API (pushState, replaceState).

- URL looks clean — e.g. /about, /products/123.

- Requires server support — meaning your server should redirect all routes to index.html (so the React app can handle routing).

### Pros:

- Clean URLs (no #)

- Feels more like a traditional website

- Better for SEO if you’re doing server-side rendering

### Cons:

- Needs server configuration (e.g., if someone visits /about directly, your server needs to serve the React app, not return 404)

 

## HashRouter

- Uses URL hash (window.location.hash) to keep track of routes.

- URL looks like this: http://example.com/#/about

- No server config needed — everything after # is handled on the client side.

### Pros:

- Works out of the box, even on static file servers (like GitHub Pages)

- No server-side routing config needed

### Cons:

- URLs look less clean (#/path)

- Not ideal for SEO

- Less "native" experience

## Quick Example:

### BrowserRouter:

```jsx

<BrowserRouter>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
  </Routes>
</BrowserRouter>
```

### HashRouter:

```jsx

<HashRouter>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
  </Routes>
</HashRouter>
```
