# What is the purpose of the useRef hook, and how does it differ from createRef?

## Feature	                                       useRef()	                                                     createRef()

Used in	                                   Function components	                                Class components (or legacy use in funcs)

Reference persistence	                Persistent across re-renders	                                New ref on every render

Typical use case	                    Accessing DOM, storing mutable values	             Mostly used to access DOM in class components

Re-renders when changed?	                No – doesn’t cause re-render	                      No – also doesn’t cause re-render

## Why useRef is preferred in function components ?

- If you use createRef() inside a functional component, it creates a new ref on every render, which defeats the point of a persistent reference.
-  
- That’s why useRef() is the go-to choice in function components — it gives you a stable object.
