# What are the core principles of Redux?

- Redux is built around three core principles that make state management more predictable and easier to debug. 
Here they are:

## 1. Single Source of Truth
- The entire state of your app is stored in a single JavaScript object, called the store.

- This makes it easier to debug, inspect, persist, or rehydrate state across our app.

Example:
```js
const state = {
  user: { name: 'Alice' },
  cart: [ { id: 1, name: 'Book', qty: 2 } ]
};
```

## 2. State is Read-Only
- The only way to change the state is by dispatching an action, which is a plain object describing what happened.

- We canâ€™t directly modify the state; this ensures all changes can be tracked and logged.

Example:
```js
dispatch({ type: 'ADD_ITEM', payload: { id: 2, name: 'Pen' } });
```

## 3. Changes are Made with Pure Functions
- State changes are handled by reducers, which are pure functions.

- Given the same input, a reducer will always return the same output, without side effects.

Example Reducer:
```js
function cartReducer(state = [], action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_ITEM':
      return [...state, action.payload];
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

### Together, these principles give Redux its superpowers: 
- predictability,
- maintainability,
- and a solid foundation for debugging and testing.
