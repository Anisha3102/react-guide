# What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components

- In React, controlled and uncontrolled components refer to how form data is handled in a component. The key difference lies in where the form data is managed—by the React state or directly by the DOM.

## Controlled Components
A controlled component is a form element (like <input>, <textarea>, or <select>) whose value is controlled by React using useState (or any other state management technique).

### Characteristics:
- React state is the "single source of truth."

- The form element's value is updated via an onChange handler.

- Enables validation, conditional rendering, and instant form updates.

### Example:
```jsx
function ControlledInput() {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState("");

  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      value={value}
      onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}
    />
  );
}
```

## Uncontrolled Components
- An uncontrolled component uses the DOM itself to handle the form element’s state, typically accessed using a ref.

### Characteristics:
- The form element maintains its own internal state.

- We read values when needed (e.g. on form submission).

- Less React overhead, sometimes better for simple or large forms.

### Example:
```jsx
function UncontrolledInput() {
  const inputRef = React.useRef();

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    alert(inputRef.current.value);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
    </>
  );
}
```
| Feature                     | Controlled Component                    | Uncontrolled Component                       |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Data source**             | React state                             | DOM (via `ref`)                              |
| **Updates on change**       | Yes (`onChange` updates state)          | No (DOM updates internally)                  |
| **Validation/Conditionals** | Easy and dynamic                        | Harder and manual                            |
| **Default values**          | Set via `value` prop and state          | Set via `defaultValue` attribute             |
| **Best for**                | Complex forms needing logic             | Simple or fast forms, third-party libraries  |
