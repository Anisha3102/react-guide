# How do you pass props to a component? 

- Passing props to a component in React is super easy â€” you just add them like HTML attributes when we use the component!

## Example:
- Let's say we have a component called Welcome:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

- Now, when we want to pass a prop to it:

```jsx
<Welcome name="Alice" />
```
- Here, name="Alice" is the prop.

- Inside the Welcome component, we access it with props.name.

## Class Component Example:
```jsx
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}
```
### Same usage:

```jsx
<Welcome name="Bob" />
```

## Key Points:
- Props are read-only (we can't modify them inside the child component).

- We can pass strings, numbers, objects, arrays, functions, even other components as props.

- If we want to pass multiple props, just add more attributes:

```jsx
<Profile name="Charlie" age={30} isActive={true} />
```
