# How do you use useLayoutEffect and how does it differ from useEffect? 

## What is useLayoutEffect?
- useLayoutEffect works just like useEffect, but it runs synchronously after all DOM mutations, before the browser paints the screen.

### This means:

- It's great for reading layout, measuring DOM nodes, or doing any synchronous visual updates that must happen before the screen updates.

# useEffect                                       vs                                                 useLayoutEffect

Hook	                                     When It Runs	                                          Use For

useEffect	                              Async, after paint	               Data fetching, subscriptions, side effects that don’t affect layout

useLayoutEffect                        	Sync, after DOM changes, before paint	       Measuring layout, adjusting scroll, style tweaks



## Analogy:

- Think of useEffect as “after everything settles,” while useLayoutEffect is like “before anyone sees what happened.
