#  How does Redux work with React?

## Core Concepts of Redux

### Store: 
The central place that holds the entire state of your app.

### Actions: 
Plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened.

### Reducers: 
Pure functions that take the current state and an action, and return a new state.

### Dispatch: 
A function you use to send actions to the store.


## React + Redux Workflow

- React Component triggers an event (e.g., button click).

- Component dispatches an action (e.g., { type: 'INCREMENT' }).

- Redux reducer handles that action and returns a new state.

- Redux store updates with the new state.

- React subscribes to the store using useSelector or connect, and re-renders based on the new state.


## Integration with React

### There are two main tools to hook Redux into React:

#### React-Redux (official bindings)
Provider: 
Wraps our app and provides the Redux store.

useSelector:
Lets us select pieces of state from the store.

useDispatch: 
Lets we dispatch actions from a component.

```jsx
import { Provider, useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { createStore } from 'redux';

// Reducer
const counter = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT': return state + 1;
    case 'DECREMENT': return state - 1;
    default: return state;
  }
};

const store = createStore(counter);

function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector(state => state);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  
  return (
    <>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })}>-</button>
    </>
  );
}

// App
export default function App() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <Counter />
    </Provider>
  );
}
```
