# What is the render() method used for in React?

- The render() method in React is used inside class components to tell React what to display on the screen.

- Basically, whenever you create a class component, we must have a render() method — and it must return some JSX (or null) that represents the UI we want to show.

## Example:
```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Hello extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}
```

- The render() method runs every time the component needs to update (like when props or state change).

- Whatever we return from render() will be displayed on the page.

## Important: 
- Render() must return one root element (so usually you wrap things in a <div> or <> </> fragment if needed).

## Quick Points:
- Required in class components.

- Returns JSX (or sometimes null if we don’t want to render anything).

- Runs automatically when component updates.

- In functional components, we don't use render(). Instead, the whole function itself acts like a render method!
