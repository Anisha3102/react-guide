# What are synthetic events in React? 

- In React, synthetic events are React's cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native events. They wrap around the native DOM events and provide a consistent API that works the same across all browsers.

## Why Synthetic Events?
- Different browsers have slightly different implementations of events (like onclick, onchange, etc.). Reactâ€™s SyntheticEvent system ensures that your event handlers behave the same regardless of the browser being used.

## Key Features of Synthetic Events
# Cross-browser compatibility: 
React normalizes the event system so you don't have to write browser-specific code.

# Performance: 
React pools synthetic events. This means React reuses event objects for performance reasons. After the event callback has run, the SyntheticEvent object will be reused and all properties will be nullified.

#Unified API: 
Synthetic events mirror the native event API but also work identically in all browsers.

## Common Usage
```jsx

function MyButton() {
  const handleClick = (event) => {
    console.log(event); // SyntheticEvent
    console.log(event.type); // "click"
    console.log(event.target); // element clicked
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
}
```
